#summary Roadmap for Otis

== Roadmap == 
This is the current roadmap for Otis library. It contains features which are needed, as well as features which are fun. Some of them will probably never be implemented. It could also be changed at any time. Feel free to suggest anything you think might be missing.

=== Version 0.1 (Current) ===
  * Configuration via attributes and XML
  * XML sources: standalone file, embedded resource
  * Standard expression mapping
  * IList <-> Array
  * XML schema to support intellisense in Visual Studio
  * Custom configuration providers
  * Assembler generation:  in-memory, on the file system, source code only
  * Helper functions for custom conversions
  * Expression formatting
  * Null Value handling

=== Version 0.2 (expected beginning of December, 2007) ===
  * Cumulative functions
  * Better default value handling (also for value types)

=== Version 0.3 ===
  * NHibernate uninitialized collections and references
  * Factories, factory methods
  * Enum conversions

=== Version 0.4 ===
  * Events for hooking into conversion process
  * Inheritance issues
  * Better debugging support

=== Version 0.5 ===
  * Move all strings to resources
  * Localization (e.g. for !DateTime conversions)
  
=== Future versions ===
  * Reverse (bidirectional) conversion
  * Tool for generation of XML mapping from attributes
  * Object->map transformation: user.!FirstName -> userMap["!FirstName"]
  * Statistics
  * Contexts
  * Mapping via delegates (something like {{{[Map({(User u) => u.First + " " + u.Last})]}}} in C#3.0)
